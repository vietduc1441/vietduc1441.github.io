---

introduction: 
- I am javascript developer. Like many others, i got to review, merge code, check code before commit, from colleages. Quite offent, i also work with mendix in server side. 
  Great tool for business engineer, but what they missed is a real comparision tool for their code.
  What mendix can do.
  What user want more.
- That makes me think
Why implement now:

- just have SDK opened, making it possible to developer to read all mendix app info: mf, forms, domain models
